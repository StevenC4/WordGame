Correct word streak
* When you get multiple correct words in a row, you start a streak
    * Streaks are counted on their own reducer / state object - per employee, per team, and overall
    * For each point you get in a row, the streak increases
    * When you click "Skip", the streak is reset to 0
    * It's technically not a streak until you get more than 1
    * Maybe it should only be a streak when you get 3+ or 5+ in a row
    * We can keep track of who has the biggest streak (player and team)
        * The team with the biggest streak at the end gets +5 points
        * Or, whenever the other team beats your teams streak, they get +5 points
    * In the awards at the end, show the player with the longest streak

Awards:
* Player with most total points
* Player with the most points in a particular category
    * This could be based on a statistical analysis to see if the player does significantly better than the others in a particular category
* Player with the biggest streak
* Player with fastest WPM (overall or per category)
* Player with the most skips (anti-award)
* Player with the hardest words

Skips:
* Each player could have 2 (or 3) skips per turn
* Skips could be worth .5 points if you don't use them
